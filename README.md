# Torrent2Drive
This is a Python Script to download Torrents directly to your Google Drive (For seamless experience execute script in Colab.)
I have Provided it in both iPython Notebook as well as a Py file. Though iPython on colab is recommended.
Advantage of this method is that you get ridiculous download speeds.
!!Kudos!!
